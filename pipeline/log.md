# Handover log

Newest at the bottom. One entry per handover: date, who, what changed, what is open, what the other side has to know.

- Set up `pipeline/` (workflow, contract, tasks 00 to 06). The old `docs/asset-pipeline.md` is removed, its earlier content is in `history.md`.
- Painted player rig is in the game (v0.52): parts in `assets/hero/rig/`, layout in `js/hero.js`, built by `tools/build_hero.py`, drawn by `drawHero` in `js/art.js` with the code figure as fallback. Pivots and swing angles are the old ones, so attack arcs did not move. Weapon icons are rotated into the hand; their length is set from the hit reach (`HWL`).
- `index.html?debug=hit` draws player radius, enemy radii and the melee sector. Use it for every character sprite.
- Style: new art gets brighter, saturated signature colours (style bible, "Item colour"). The rust-brown starter look stays only for what exists.
- Open for Codex: task 00 first (tooling plus ghoul end to end).

## 2026-11-09 · Claude (second pass)

- Rig v1 fixes: torsos centred on the body (not the scarf), shoulder pivot moves with them; weapons with the tip pointing down on the sheet flipped (`WFIX` in `tools/build_hero.py`: Klinge der Zitadelle, Speer der Siegessäule, Neonflinte, Mikroständer, Zorn der Ringbahn), slingshot and sling with fixed grips; hammer at rest is dragged head down in front.
- Johannes wants v2 with a mannequin base body, fists and every outfit as a layer: task 07. Do it after 00, before or alongside 01.
- Docs: `CLAUDE.md` is the only index, `AGENTS.md` only points to it. This folder holds topic files: `workflow.md`, `contract.md`, `tasks/`, this log.
- Roles changed (Johannes): Codex does tasks end to end, including rig and code integration. Claude plans, reviews and debugs. See `workflow.md`, Roles.
